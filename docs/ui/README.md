# UI Wireframes

This folder contains low-fidelity wireframes for the MyClosetB application. The wireframes were created to guide the implementation of the dashboard, wardrobe item registration, and look creation experiences.

- `dashboard-wireframe.md`: Overview dashboard displaying wardrobe statistics and activity.
- `inventory-wireframe.md`: Form flow for adding and managing clothing pieces.
- `look-builder-wireframe.md`: Guided interface for composing outfits from wardrobe items.

Each wireframe documents layout regions, accessibility considerations, and responsive behaviour so developers and designers can collaborate effectively.
